# Message Slot Kernel Module

This repository contains the implementation of a kernel module that introduces a novel inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism known as a "message slot." 

A message slot functions as a character device file, facilitating communication between processes by enabling them to send and receive messages across various channels.
